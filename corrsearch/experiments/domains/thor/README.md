The code here uses Ai2Thor's RoboTHOR.

The `ai2thor` package version used is [2.7.2](https://github.com/allenai/ai2thor/releases/tag/2.7.2).


### Plan

1. Determine if there is a reasonable joint distribution between objects

2. Which 10 objects should be used as targets?

3. How to define and implement detectors?

4. How to define transition?

5. How to perform object search with groundtruth object detections? (with artificial noise?)

6. If still have time, try using a real vision detector?
